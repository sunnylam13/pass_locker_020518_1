# Password Locker Insecure

You probably have accounts on many different websites. It’s a bad habit to use the same password for each of them because if any of those sites has a security breach, the hackers will learn the password to all of your other accounts. It’s best to use password manager software on your computer that uses one master password to unlock the password manager. Then you can copy any account password to the clipboard and paste it into the website’s Password field.

The password manager program you’ll create in this example isn’t secure, but it offers a basic demonstration of how such programs work.
